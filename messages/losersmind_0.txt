Hey there [Team Name]! Took ya long enough, welcome to Level 2! There won’t be a break for you guys coming in, but be sure to finish your waters and bust out that juice! 

All the Level 2 rules regarding cursing, counting, and possibly accents, still apply. Now go give the other guys a run for their money!!!

 Type `--continue` when you’ve finished your drinks and are ready to proceed
