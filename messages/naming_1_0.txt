Nice game name nerds. Alright, it's time to get this started.

Your first task is to come up with **team names and make player tokens**. Why? Well, the team that wins will get to destroy the other teams player tokens! Multimedia crafts are encouraged, but MSpaint drawings will also suffice. Split up into your team channels to brainstorm and craft for ~5 minutes. 

Need inspiration? Some Donkey Brained Jabronies came up with these names and tokens.
