TIMES UP!

Smash your can and intimidate the other team as best you can. Scream, Flex, whatever it takes: prepare then for the coming storm. Make them feel the pain their tokens will experience at the completion of the game.

Type `--continue` when you feel everyone has been sufficiently intimidated.
