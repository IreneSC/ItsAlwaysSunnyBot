Congratulations [Team Name] On making it to Level 2: Body! It’s been a bit of a wild few rounds huh? Let’s take a moment to let civility reign with the **Pre-Level 2 Break**!

At this time, the team ascending to Level 2 should finish their glasses of water and bust out the juice, because there’s going to be a lot of that flowing in the next level. Remember that questions can be asked freely until the end of this break!

An important thing to note is that when the game resumes at the end of this Break, there are a couple of rule changes: 
○  There is now no more cursing allowed outside of breaks! If this rule is broken, then the entire team of the 
     offender must drink their beverages for 5 seconds. This is really not great, since from now:
○   If a team has to drink for any period of time for rule breaking,** the other team counts the 5 seconds**! Time 
      really is relative isn’t it?
○   In addition, an optional challenge you can both choose to adopt is the Accent challenge:
          ○ Both teams pick a random country <https://earthroulette.com/>.For the rest of the Level the teams must 
              speak in the accent of the country they randomly picked. In case someone does not/ forgets to do so, the 
              team must drink
Now everybody takes **2 minutes** to sip on their beverages and enjoy each-others company for a moment. Be convincing will ya?
