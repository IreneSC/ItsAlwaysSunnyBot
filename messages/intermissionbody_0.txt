Things are really heating up now! Welcome [Team Name] to Level 3: Spirit! Now before things really start getting deep, we’re going to go ahead and take our last intermission, the **Pre-Level 3 Break**!

[Team Name], go ahead and finish your juices and pour yourself out a healthy serving of coffee. Things are about to get caffeinated! Remember that during an intermission you can feel free to ask questions and swear as much as you’d like, for now you’re above the law.

The only rule change coming in hot this time around is:
○  If a team passes or fails a Spirit card drawn, and there is no attempt to steal from the other team, **everybody 
     in the game drinks**!

All other Level 2 rules still apply. You have **2 minutes** of freedom before it’s back to the blood-bath, enjoy it while you can!
